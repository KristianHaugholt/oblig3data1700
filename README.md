Summary of code: 
The program allows the user to buy tickets by clicking a button,
given that the input data is valid.
The data will then be saved to the h2 database with the use
of a post request. Then it will follow up with a get request
to get all the tickets from the database sorted by surnames,
and format them into a table. The user can delete all tickets
with a delete button. I used Bootstrap to style the page.
